version as well.The project demonstrates basic Java OOP concepts and GUI programming with JavaFX.


## Console Version

To run the console version:
1. Open the project in IntelliJ.
2. Navigate to `Main.java` in the `Todo` package.
3. Run the `Main` class.
4. Use the number menu to manage your tasks in the terminal.

## GUI Version (JavaFX)

The GUI version is built using JavaFX.

## How to Run:
1. Make sure you have the **JavaFX SDK
2. Add the `lib` folder of the JavaFX SDK as a library in IntelliJ 
3. Go to `Run > Edit Configurations` and add the following to **VM Options** (change path if needed):


## Run the `TodoListGUI.java` file.

Youâ€™ll get a simple window to:
- Add tasks
- Mark tasks as done
